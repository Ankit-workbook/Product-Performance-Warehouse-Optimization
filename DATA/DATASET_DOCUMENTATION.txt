5. OPTIMIZATION_ANALYSIS.CSV (COMPREHENSIVE DATASET)
   Contains all above data plus optimization metrics:
   - Profit_Per_Cubic_Foot: Key optimization metric
   - Revenue_Per_Cubic_Foot: Space efficiency measure
   - Storage_Efficiency_Ratio: Profit relative to storage cost
   - Warehouse_ROI_Percent: Return on warehouse investment

   - Optimization_Recommendation: Action recommendations

üéØ OPTIMIZATION USE CASES:

1. IDENTIFY UNDERPERFORMING PRODUCTS:
   - Low Profit_Per_Cubic_Foot
   - High warehouse costs relative to profit
   - Poor inventory turnover

2. SPACE OPTIMIZATION:
   - Products with high space usage but low profit
   - Opportunities to reallocate prime warehouse zones

3. FINANCIAL OPTIMIZATION:
   - Products where warehouse costs exceed profit
   - ROI analysis for space allocation

4. SEASONAL PLANNING:
   - Quarterly sales patterns for capacity planning
   - Demand trends for inventory management

5. PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION:
   - Performance categories for strategic decisions
   - Removal candidates vs. growth opportunities

üìà KEY METRICS FOR ANALYSIS:

PROFITABILITY:
- Profit_Per_Cubic_Foot (primary optimization metric)
- Warehouse_ROI_Percent
- Storage_Efficiency_Ratio

EFFICIENCY:
- Inventory_Turnover_Ratio
- Days_in_Inventory
- Space_Utilization_Score

RISK:
- Stockout_Risk
- Break_Even_Units_Annual
- Performance_Category

üîç SAMPLE ANALYSIS QUESTIONS:

1. Which products should be removed to maximize profit per square foot?
2. How much warehouse space can be freed by removing poor performers?
3. What are the seasonal patterns by category?
4. Which products need increased stock levels?
5. What's the ROI of different warehouse zones?
6. How do different product lifecycle stages perform?

üí° BUSINESS SCENARIOS SIMULATED:

- Realistic seasonal sales patterns
- Variable storage costs by product type
- Lifecycle-based demand patterns
- Mixed performance across categories
- Real-world cost structures
- Risk-based recommendations
